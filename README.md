# Cracking-Ciphers
Cracking using probabilistic programming

I decrypt here substitution cipher with statistical algorithms, next i try something more difficult stronger encryption algorithms and maybe side channels attack on embedded devices.

##### Algorithm:
- Hidden Markov Model
- MCMC Metropolis Hasting
- Neural Network
