# Cracking-Ciphers
Cracking using probabilistic programming

I decrypt here substitution cipher with statistical algorithms, next i try something more difficult stronger encryption algorithms and maybe side channels attack on embedded devices.

### Algorithms
- Hidden Markov Model
- MCMC Metropolis Hasting
- Neural Network


### Details
Decrypting works for long sentence and in specific language, for random characters doesn't.

For next improvement i change from one letter transition probability sequence likelihood to whole word(probability of existence word in language), and next for whole sentence it should improve.
